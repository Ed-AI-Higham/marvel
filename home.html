                <p class="flex22">It's 1941 and the war is raging on. Backed by the HYDRA organisation, the Nazi's are pushing
                    harder than ever. Back in the states, everyone's being recruited. Apart from Steve Rogers that is. Due to his
                    short height, low self-esteem and natural small
                    build, the army doesn't want him. Dr. Abraham Erskine on the other hand sees the perfect opportunity to create
                    the super soldier. It's not always what's on the outside that counts. Will Steve Rogers become who he is
                    destined to be and destroy HYDRA
                    and the Red Skull for ever?</p>

                        emerged from the pod upon turning into Captain America, was very much improvised, and the surprise on her
                        face is genuine, as she admitted in
                        interviews she was very taken by Chris' physique and nearly broke character and ruined the take that made
                        it into the film.</li>
                    <li>Chris Evans declined the role three times before accepting the part. Not out of dislike for the role, but
                        because he feared what the effects of the sudden increase of fame would be on his private life. Then Robert
                        Downey, Jr. convinced him to take
                        the part, and thus gain the freedom to sign on any other role he'd want afterwards.</li>
                    <li>Chris Evans was paid $300,000 to play the title role.</li>

                        simply saying "Assemble", prompting a night out on the town. Clark Gregg has stated that this is his favourite

                    relative appears in the picture. T'Challa must work out what to do and stay on top of his opponenent. With a
                    waterfall of responsibilities, what
                    will he do?</p>

                    <li>Co-stars Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke, who play adversaries Nakia and M'Baku, were students at the Yale
                        School of Drama at the same time. They saw The Avengers (2012) together when it released, and were so
                        awestruck by it they said hoped to get
                        a chance to star in a similar film one day.</li>
                    <li>To prepare for his role, Michael B. Jordan kept to himself while he was on set, reasoning that his
                        character Killmonger is distant and in conflict with the other characters.</li>
                    <li>In response to being asked what it felt like being one of the only few non-black actors on set (and
                        sometimes the only non-black actor on set), Martin Freeman said "You think, 'Right, this is what black
                        ctors feel like all the time?'".</li>

                <p class="flex22">A culmination of 10 years and 18 films of hard work, brings the MCU to the most anticipated
                    film in history. Everything the Avengers hold dear and have fought for will be tested in the fast paced 'heist'
                    styled film. Thanos and his Children (Proxima
                    Midnight, Korvus Claive, Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian) set on a quest to plunge half of all living things into
                    extinction. At the most critical time in their lives, the Avengers are not the closest that they can be after
                    the events of Civil War. How
                    will they cope with such a consequence at stake and how many stones will Thanos collect?</p>

                        compared their facial hair, reasoning that they have known each other long enough to have that kind of
                        friendly banter.</li>
                    <li>With a budget window of three hundred sixteen to four hundred million dollars, this is the most expensive
                        movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date, and the most expensive superhero movie of all time so far.</li>

                    <li>This movie was announced three months after Ant-Man (2015) was released and, due to Marvel's packed Phase
                        Three lineup, they had to move the release dates of Black Panther (2018) and Captain Marvel (2019).</li>
